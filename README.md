## ü§ñ What is Frogbot?
Frogbot is a git bot that scans your pull requests with [JFrog Xray](https://jfrog.com/xray/) for security vulnerabilities. Frogbot adds the scan results as a comment on the pull request. If no vulnerabilities are found, Frogbot will also add a comment, confirming this. 
Currently GitHub and GitLab are supported. Bitbucket will be supported soon.
Projects that use one of the following tools to download their dependencies are currently supported.
* Npm
* Maven
* Gradle
* Go
* Pip
* Pipenv
* Nuget
* Dotnet

## üïµ How does it work?
### General
After a new pull request is created, a maintainer of the git repository can trigger Frogbot to scan the pull request. The scan is triggered from the git UI. The scan output will include only new vulnerabilities added by the pull request. Vulnerabilities that aren't new and existed in the code prior to the pull request creation will not be added to the report.

### On GitHub
1. A developer opens a pull request
2. If missing, Frogbot creates the `üê∏ frogbot scan` label in the repository
3. A maintainer of the repository assigns the `üê∏ frogbot scan` label on this pull request
4. Frogbot gets triggered by the label, scans the pull request, adds a comment with the scan results and removes the label from the pull request
5. Frogbot can be triggered again following new commits, by adding the label to the pull request again

### On GitLab
1. A developer opens a merge request
2. A maintainer of the repository triggers the manual frogbot-scan job
3. Frogbot gets triggered by the job, scans the merge request and adds a comment with the scan results
4. Frogbot can be triggered again following new commits, by trigerring the frogbot-scan job again

## Pull Request Comments
### üëç No issues
If no vulnerabilities were found, Frogbot will automatically add the following comment to the pull request:

### üëé Issues were found
If vulnerabilities were found, Frogbot will add them in a comment on the pull request. For example:

## üñ•Ô∏è Installing and Using Frogbot
### General
1. Frogbot requires a JFrog environment to scan pull requests with. Don't have a JFrog environment? No problem - [Set Up a FREE JFrog Environment in the Cloud](#set-up-a-free-jfrog-environment-in-the-cloud). You'll later save its connection details (URL, username and password) as secrets in git.
2. Setting up Frogbot on a GitHub repository? [Install Frogbot using GitHub Actions](#install-frogbot-using-github-actions)
3. Setting up Frogbot on a GitLab repository? [Install Frogbot using GitLab CI](#install-frogbot-using-gitlab-ci)

### Set Up a FREE JFrog Environment in the Cloud
Need a FREE JFrog environment in the cloud, which Frogbot can scan pull requests with? Just run one of the following commands in your terminal, to set up an environment in less than a minute. The commands will do the following:
* Install [JFrog CLI](https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/CLI/JFrog+CLI) on your machine.
* Create a FREE JFrog environment in the cloud for you.
After the set up is complete, you'll receive an email with your JFrog environment connection details, which you can then store as secrets in git.

**On MacOS and Linux using cUrl**
```
curl -fL https://getcli.jfrog.io?setup | sh
```
**On Windows using PowerShell**
```
powershell "Start-Process -Wait -Verb RunAs powershell '-NoProfile iwr https://releases.jfrog.io/artifactory/jfrog-cli/v2-jf/[RELEASE]/jfrog-cli-windows-amd64/jf.exe -OutFile $env:SYSTEMROOT\system32\jf.exe'" ; jf setup
```

### Install Frogbot using GitHub Actions
1. Make sure you have the connection details of your JFrog environment.
2. Save the JFrog connection details as secrets in GitHub with the following names - *JF_URL*, *JF_USER* and *JF_PASSWORD*. You can also use *JF_ACCESS_TOKEN* instead of *JF_USER* and *JF_PASSWORD*.
3. Use one of these [GitHub Actions templates](templates/github-actions/README.md#frogbot-gitHub-actions-templates) to create a file named `frogbot.yml`.
4. Push the `frogbot.yml` file to the `.github/workflow` directory at the root of your GitHub repository.

### Install Frogbot using GitLab CI
1. Make sure you have the connection details of your JFrog environment.
2. Save the JFrog connection details as secrets in GitLab with the following names - *JF_URL*, *JF_USER* and *JF_PASSWORD*. You can also use *JF_ACCESS_TOKEN* instead of *JF_USER* and *JF_PASSWORD*.
4. Add a job named `frogbot-scan` to your `.gitlab-ci.yml` file in your GitLab repository using the below structure.

**Important**

* If the project uses npm, pip, pipenv, nuget or dotnet to download its depedencies, make sure to set the command that downloads your project depedencies as the value of the *JF_INSTALL_DEPS_CMD* variable. For example, `npm i` or `nuget restore`
* Make sure that either *JF_USER* and *JF_PASSWORD* or *JF_ACCESS_TOKEN* are set, but not both.
