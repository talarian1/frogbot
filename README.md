## ü§ñ What is Frogbot?
Frogbot is a Git bot that does the following:
1. Scans pull requests for security vulnerabilities.
2. Opens pull requests with fixes for security vulnerabilities.  

## Pull requests scanning
### General 
Frogbot uses [JFrog Xray](https://jfrog.com/xray/) to scan your pull requests. It adds the scan results as a comment on the pull request. If no new vulnerabilities are found, Frogbot will also add a comment, confirming this.
For pull requests scanning, please note that **GitHub**, **GitLab** and **Bitbucket Server** are supported.
Projects that use one of the following tools to download their dependencies are currently supported.

- Npm
- Maven
- Gradle
- Go
- Pip
- Pipenv
- Nuget
- Dotnet

### üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è How does pull requests scanning work?
#### GitHub
For security reasons, Frogbot is not triggered automatically.
After you create a new pull request, the maintainer of the git repository can trigger Frogbot to scan the pull request from the pull request UI. The scan output will include only new vulnerabilities added by the pull request. Vulnerabilities that aren't new, and existed in the code prior to the pull request creation, will not be included in the report.

1. A developer opens a pull request.
2. The Frogbot workflow automatically gets triggered and a [GitHub environment](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/deployment/targeting-different-environments/using-environments-for-deployment#creating-an-environment) named _frogbot_ is pending for the maintainer's approval: 

[![](./images/github-pending-deployment.png)](#running-frogbot-on-github)

3. A Maintainer reviews the pull request and approves the scan: [![](./images/github-deployment.gif)](#running-frogbot-on-github)
4. Frogbot can be triggered again following new commits, by repeating steps 2 and 3.

#### GitLab
For security reasons, Frogbot is not triggered automatically.
After you create a new pull request, the maintainer of the git repository can trigger Frogbot to scan the pull request from the pull request UI. The scan output will include only new vulnerabilities added by the pull request. Vulnerabilities that aren't new, and existed in the code prior to the pull request creation, will not be included in the report.

1. A developer opens a merge request.
2. A maintainer of the repository triggers the manual **frogbot-scan** job.
3. Frogbot is triggered by the job, scans the merge request, and adds a comment with the scan results.
4. Frogbot can be triggered again following new commits, by triggering the **frogbot-scan** job again.

#### Bitbucket Server
After you create a new pull request, Frogbot will automatically scan it. The scan output will include only new vulnerabilities added by the pull request. Vulnerabilities that aren't new, and existed in the code prior to the pull request creation, will not be included in the report.

1. A developer opens a pull request.
2. Frogbot is triggered and scans the pull request, and adds a comment with the scan results.
3. Frogbot can be triggered again following new commits, by adding a comment with the `rescan` text.

#### Pull request comments
##### üëç No issues
If no new vulnerabilities are found, Frogbot automatically adds the following comment to the pull request:

[![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jfrog/frogbot/master/resources/noVulnerabilityBanner.png)](#-no-issues)

##### üëé Issues were found
If new vulnerabilities are found, Frogbot adds them as a comment on the pull request. For example:

## Pull requests opening
Frogbot scans your Git repository and automatically opens pull requests for upgrading vulnerable dependencies to a version with a fix.
Frogbot uses [JFrog Xray](https://jfrog.com/xray/) for the scanning. The scanning is triggered following commits that are pushed to the repository. For pull requests opening, please note that GitHub and GitLab are currently supported and Bitbucket will be supported soon. Projects that use one of the following tools to download their dependencies are currently supported.

- npm
- Maven
- Go

## üñ•Ô∏è Installing and using Frogbot
### General
1. Frogbot requires a JFrog environment to scan pull requests. Don't have a JFrog environment? No problem - [Set Up a FREE JFrog Environment in the Cloud](#set-up-a-free-jfrog-environment-in-the-cloud). You'll later save the connection details (URL, username, and password) as secrets in Git.
2. [Setting up Frogbot on GitHub repositories](#setting-up-frogbot-on-github-repositories)
3. [Setting up Frogbot on GitLab repositories](#setting-up-frogbot-on-gitlab-repositories)
4. [Setting up Frogbot on Bitbucket Server repositories](#setting-up-frogbot-on-bitbucket-server-repositories)

### Set up a FREE JFrog Environment in the cloud
Need a FREE JFrog environment in the cloud, so Frogbot can scan your pull requests?

Just run one of the following commands in your terminal, to set up an environment in less than a minute. The commands will do the following:

1. Install [JFrog CLI](https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/CLI/JFrog+CLI) on your machine.
2. Create a FREE JFrog environment in the cloud for you.

After the setup is complete, you'll receive an email with your JFrog environment connection details, which you can then store as secrets in Git.

**On macOS and Linux using cUrl**

```
curl -fL https://getcli.jfrog.io?setup | sh
```

**On Windows using PowerShell**

```
powershell "Start-Process -Wait -Verb RunAs powershell '-NoProfile iwr https://releases.jfrog.io/artifactory/jfrog-cli/v2-jf/[RELEASE]/jfrog-cli-windows-amd64/jf.exe -OutFile $env:SYSTEMROOT\system32\jf.exe'" ; jf setup
```

### Setting up Frogbot on GitHub repositories
Frogbot is installed on GitHub repositories using GitHub Actions. 
Here's how you install it:

1. Make sure you have the connection details of your JFrog environment.
2. At your GitHub repository settings, save the JFrog connection details as repository secrets with the following names - **JF_URL**, **JF_USER**, and **JF_PASSWORD** (You can also use **JF_XRAY_URL** and **JF_ARTIFACTORY_URL** instead of  **JF_URL**, and **JF_ACCESS_TOKEN** instead of **JF_USER** and **JF_PASSWORD**)
   
   ![](images/github-repository-secrets.png)

3. Make sure GitHub Actions has permissions to create pull requests.

   ![](images/github-pr-permissions.png)

4. Create a new "frogbot" [GitHub environment](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/deployment/targeting-different-environments/using-environments-for-deployment#creating-an-environment) and add people or public teams as reviewers. The chosen reviewers are authorized to trigger Frogbot scan on pull requests.

   ![](images/github-environment.png)

5. Use these [GitHub Actions templates](templates/github-actions/README.md#frogbot-gitHub-actions-templates) to add Frogbot workflows to your project.
6. Push the workflow files to the `.github/workflows` directory in the root of your GitHub repository.

### Setting up Frogbot on GitLab repositories
Frogbot is installed on GitLab repositories using GitLab CI.
Here's how you install it:

1. Make sure you have the connection details of your JFrog environment.
2. Save the JFrog connection details as secrets in GitLab with the following names: **JF_URL**, **JF_USER** and **JF_PASSWORD** (You can also use **JF_XRAY_URL** and **JF_ARTIFACTORY_URL** instead of  **JF_URL** and **JF_ACCESS_TOKEN** instead of **JF_USER** and **JF_PASSWORD**).
3. Add a job named `frogbot-scan` to your `.gitlab-ci.yml` file in your GitLab repository using the below structure.

**Important Guidelines**

- For npm, pip, pipenv, nuget or dotnet: Make sure to set the command in a way that it downloads your project dependencies as the value of the **JF_INSTALL_DEPS_CMD** variable. For example, `npm i` or `nuget restore`
- Make sure that either **JF_USER** and **JF_PASSWORD** or **JF_ACCESS_TOKEN** are set, but not both.
